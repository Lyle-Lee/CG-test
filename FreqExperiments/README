Intuitive Understanding the relationship between Signal and Frequency

To compile and run this program, execute "gradle run" or "make".

When a window is opened, push "set image" button and load an image
which is larger than 512 x 512.
Both color and grayscale images are available, but the loaded color
image is transformed into a grayscale image.

In the window, the left-hand part is the signal domain.
The first top two sliders set sigmas for two Gaussian kernels.
The first kernel is positive and the second one is negative.
Both are normalized by L1.
A custom kernel is applicable by loading an image file.
There are two modes for the loading. The first one loads an image
and normalizes it by L1. Loading an image by another mode, 
each pixel values are divided by 256 and subtracted with 0.5, and then
it is L2 normalized.

The next slider gives a magnification coefficient to pixel values.

The two buttons in the center of the window run Fourier transform and
inverse Fourier transform

The right-hand part is the frequency domain.
The top two sliders set sigmas for two Gaussian masks.
Composing two masks, a bandpass filtering is applicable.
A custom filter is also available by loading an image file.

The toggle buttons choose the normal mask designed above and the black and white reversal of it. 

The lowest slider controls the sampling interval in the signal domain.
